DietReport (the "App") takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, retain, and protect personal information in connection with the App and related services, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including references to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) where relevant.

## 1. Purpose of Collection and Use
We collect and use personal information only for the following purposes:
- To provide diet tracking and management services (store, view, edit, delete user-entered diet records)
- To improve app features and user experience (UX)
- To deliver advertisements and measure advertising effectiveness
- To analyze service errors and ensure stability

## 2. Types of Personal Information Collected and Collection Methods
We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide the service. Our basic principle is: user diet data is stored locally on the device and is not transmitted to a server unless the user explicitly enables a backup or synchronization feature.

1) Information entered directly by the user and stored locally on the device  
- Diet records: date, time, meal name, category, portion/amount (as entered by the user)  
- Category management: custom category names added/edited/deleted by the user  
- Alarm settings: alarm time, enabled/disabled status, and related settings

2) Information automatically collected (device and usage logs)  
- Device information: device model, OS version, app version, device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID), IP address, etc.  
- App usage logs: feature usage timestamps, screen navigation events, crash logs, and other diagnostic data

Collection methods: information is collected when the user enters it into the App, and some device/usage information may be collected automatically through third-party SDKs (analytics/advertising SDKs) for operational, improvement, and advertising purposes. User diet data remains local unless the user opts into any server-based backup or sync feature.

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or UK, the App's lawful bases for processing personal data include:
- Performance of a contract: processing necessary to provide the services you request (e.g., storing and retrieving your diet records)
- Consent: where required (for example, for certain analytics or advertising features), we will obtain your consent before processing
- Legitimate interests: for operational purposes such as improving the App, troubleshooting, and fraud prevention, where such interests are not overridden by your rights and freedoms

You may withdraw consent at any time where processing is based on consent. Withdrawal does not affect processing that occurred prior to withdrawal.

## 4. Rights of Data Subjects (GDPR) and California Residents (CCPA)
GDPR (EEA/UK residents):  
You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing of, or obtain portability of your personal data. You also have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

CCPA (California residents):  
If you are a California resident, you have the right to request: (1) disclosure of categories of personal information collected and the specific pieces of personal information collected about you, (2) deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), and (3) to opt out of the sale of your personal information. The App does not intentionally sell personal information; however, advertising identifiers used for ad personalization may be considered a sale under some interpretations—users can opt out via device settings and advertising opt-out mechanisms.

To exercise any of these rights, contact: strictenglish@gmail.com (Responsible person: Junyoung Park). We will respond in accordance with applicable law.

## 5. Consent and Choices
- Diet records and other data stored locally are created and managed by the user through the App. Users can view, modify, or delete these entries at any time within the App.  
- Advertising identifiers and other automatically collected items can be limited, reset, or disabled via device settings (for example, on Android the advertising ID can be reset or ad personalization turned off; on iOS, users can limit ad tracking or reset the advertising identifier).  
- Where required by law, the App will request consent for analytics and advertising processing.

## 6. Retention and Use Period
- Local data (user diet records, categories, alarms, etc.): retained on the device until the user deletes the data or uninstalls the App.  
- Upon app uninstallation: local app data (databases, caches, etc.) are removed according to the mobile OS uninstall procedure and cannot be recovered.  
- Logs and data transmitted to third parties (via advertising/analytics SDKs): retention and management are subject to the respective third party's policies. Please refer to those providers' privacy policies for details.

## 7. Third-Party Sharing (including Google AdMob)
The App does not provide sensitive personal identification information such as diet records to third parties. However, to deliver advertising and analytics, the App may share non-identifying information with third parties as described below.

- Recipients: Google AdMob (advertising network) and other third-party advertising/analytics providers used by the App  
- Examples of shared information: advertising identifier (Advertising ID), device information (model, OS version), app version, anonymized usage events, IP address, and other non-identifying data needed for ad delivery and measurement  
- Purpose of sharing: to provide personalized and non-personalized ads, measure advertising effectiveness, and analyze ad performance  
- Retention: data provided to AdMob and other providers is retained and managed according to those providers' internal policies and terms of service

Google may process information collected through AdMob in accordance with Google's privacy and advertising policies. For more details, please review Google's Privacy Policy and AdMob policies.

If a user does not wish to have their advertising identifier collected, they may disable or reset the advertising identifier in their device settings (e.g., Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization or reset advertising ID; iOS: Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising / reset advertising identifier).

When the App shares data with third parties, we inform users in advance of the recipients, purposes of sharing, types of information shared, and retention periods where applicable.

## 8. Data Deletion Procedures and Methods
- If a user deletes an individual data entry (such as a diet record) within the App, that data is immediately removed from the local database.  
- When a user uninstalls the App, all app-related local data (databases, caches, etc.) are deleted according to the mobile OS uninstall process and cannot be recovered.  
- Data already transmitted to third parties (advertising/analytics providers) will be handled and deleted according to those third parties' retention and deletion policies.

## 9. Automatic Collection Devices (Cookies, Advertising Identifiers)
- Cookies: The mobile App does not use browser cookies.  
- Advertising Identifier: Advertising identifiers (Advertising ID on Android, Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) on iOS) may be collected by advertising SDKs (including Google AdMob) for ad measurement and personalization purposes. Users can reset or limit collection of these identifiers via device settings.  
- Information collected and processing performed by advertising/analytics SDKs are governed by the privacy policies of those SDK providers.

For Google's advertising and partner policies, see: https://policies.google.com/privacy and AdMob documentation.

## 10. Security Measures
To protect personal information, the App implements the following technical and administrative safeguards:
- Local-first storage principle to minimize risks associated with server-side breaches  
- Secure transmission protocols (e.g., TLS) for any data that may be sent off-device  
- Principle of least privilege for access control and internal management policies  
- Periodic security checks and vulnerability fixes

We plan to introduce additional protections (e.g., encryption of sensitive local data) in future updates; such changes will be communicated in this Policy.

## 11. International Transfer
Some data collected for service operation, advertising, or analytics may be transferred to third parties located outside your country (for example, Google). When international transfers occur, the data will be processed in accordance with the recipient's policies and applicable law.

## 12. Dispute Resolution and Complaints
If you have questions, complaints, or requests for relief related to privacy, please contact the responsible person by email at strictenglish@gmail.com. We will promptly review and respond to inquiries in accordance with applicable law.

## 13. Policy Changes and Notices
This Policy may be amended as required by changes in law or service operations. When we make material changes, we will notify users via an in-app notice or by updating this document. Significant changes will be communicated clearly and in a timely manner.

This Privacy Policy summarizes DietReport's practices regarding personal information. Actual operations (such as whether advertising/analytics SDKs are used or if server synchronization is implemented) may vary; any such differences will be reflected in updates to this Policy.
